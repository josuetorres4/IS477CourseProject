Housing affordability is a growing concern in a lot of different major U.S. cities which includes Chicago. Chicago provides a diverse landscape of neighborhoods that vary greatly in both income levels and housing prices. I personally am from Chicago and this project aims to explore how income levels correlate with housing prices across Chicago’s neighborhoods to then better understand patterns of affordability, inequality, and maybe even possibly spatial segregation. I will do this by integrating datasets on housing market values and demographic income data and the project will identify trends, disparities, and possible contributing factors affecting affordability. My project will apply different concepts from data lifecycle management, ethical data handling, and reproducibility to ensure transparency and accountability. 

Some research questions that I came up with would be: 
How do median household income levels relate to housing prices across different Chicago neighborhoods?

Do neighborhoods with higher median incomes consistently have higher average housing prices?

Are there outlier neighborhoods where income and housing costs are disproportionately mismatched?



I am working on the project by myself so I will be doing all of the data cleaning, collecting, integration, analysis, and reporting. 

The datasets that I will be using are “Real Estate Data Chicago 2024” and “Chicago Community Area Income and Demographic Data”.  “Real Estate Data Chicago 2024” is a compiled dataset of Chicago property listings and prices. It iIncludes information on property sales, prices, square footage, and locations categorized by community area. Some variables of interest would be the description of the home and lastSoldPrice. I will use these to calculate median housing prices per community area and link with income data for analysis.  “Chicago Community Area Income and Demographic Data” uses 2023 demographic and income distribution data for Chicago's community areas. It contains socioeconomic indicators for each of Chicago’s 77 community areas, including median household income, population, education level, and race. I will use this dataset to analyze how median household income relates to property prices across areas.


My timeline will be as follows: Data Cleaning & Integration (Oct 10-20), Exploratory Data Analysis (Oct 21-30), Interim Status Report (Nov 11), Correlation and Regression Analysis (Nov 12-25), Visualization and Mapping (Nov 26- Dec 3), Workflow Automation and Documentation (Dec 4-8), and then the Final Submission(Dec 10)

Some constraints that I’m worried about is that some community areas may have missing or inconsistent entries, community area codes must align correctly between datasets, and lack of a "neighborhood" variable in one dataset.

Gaps: The real estate data set is pretty limited since I’m gonna have to look at the “text” variable to see what neighborhoods the houses are in. I couldn’t find any other datasets with chicago real estate so I would need additional input on that.
